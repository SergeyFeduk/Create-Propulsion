    //TODO: Tilt adapter ponder
    //Show a powered tilt adapter connected to mechanical bearing
    // - Place a wing in front of the mechanical bearing (or have this in initial setup)
    // - Power one side of the tilt adapter, wait till mechanical bearing rotates to target angle ("Tilt adapter allows to tilt output shaft based on redstone signal" word ts better)
    // - Power other side of the tilt adapter, wait
    // - Keeping the 2nd side powered - power the first and wait till bearing returns to original position ("Connected bearings are guaranteed to return to their initial position")
    // - Turn the 2nd side off, wait
    // - Turn the 1st side off, wait
