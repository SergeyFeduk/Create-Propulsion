<h1 align="center">Create: Propulsion</h1>

<p align="left">is an addon for Create and Valkyrien Skies 2 adding new ways to propel and control your crafts, all in Create mod style!</p>

# What does it add?

## Methods of propulsion
- Thruster: Provides thrust to vehicles. Controllable by redstone.
- Creative Thruster: Produces a variable amount of thrust based on redstone signal level and its configuration. Particle type is configurable.
- Propeller: A new method of propulsion that requires RPM, blades, and some empty space around them. Comes with 3 different blade types: Wooden, Copper and Andesite blades.

## Redstone components
- Inline Optical Sensor: Basic and small raycast block detector.
- Optical Sensor: Configurable raycast block detector. Set target distance and filter by block type.
- Lodestone Tracker: Tracks lodestone blocks with compass bound to them.
- Redstone Transmission: A block that allows precise control of RPM with redstone signals. Has two modes: Direct and Incremental. 

## Hot Air Balloons
- Envelope: Serves as a shell for balloons. Can be dyed.
- Enveloped shaft: Allows to pass rotation through the envelope without creating a hole in the balloon.
- Hot Air Burner: An early-game way to fill balloons with hot air. Burns solid fuels.
- Hot Air Pump: Requires rotation and heat source to produce a large amount of hot air. RPM can be used to finely control the amount of hot air injected, and therefore altitude.

## Heat system
- Solid Burner: Produces a moderate amount of heat by burning solid fuels.
- Liquid Burner: Produces a large amount of heat by burning liquid fuels. Allows liquid to pass through it.
- Stirling engine: Generates RPM when heat is provided from below. 

## Miscellaneous stuff
- Redstone Magnet: Attracts or repels other magnets based on polarity.
- Physics Assembler: Assembles blocks into physical entities.
- Tilt Adapter: Allows to rotate shafts by set angles. In combination with a mechanical bearing, it can be used to create control surfaces for planes.

# FAQ:
### When will you add Create 6 support?
- Create: Propulsion is already compatible with Create 6!
### Will Create: Propulsion be ported to Fabric?
- Yes, not sure when though.
### Thrusters (or other feature) is over/underpowered
- Modify corresponding values in configuration menu. Pretty much everything is configurable!
### Is there any compat with Computer Craft?
- Yes, see [Wiki](https://github.com/SergeyFeduk/Create-Propulsion/wiki/ComputerCraft-peripherals).
### Do you plan to add *X*?
- Check my [Discord](https://discord.gg/knB8UV3bzZ) for roadmap.
